<br>

I am Tong Zhao, pursuing Ph.D. degree at the School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. Yintao Wei. I am also a visiting student at the [MSC Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/) in UC Berkeley, under the supervision of Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka. I received my Bachelor degree from Xiamen University (XMU) in 2020. 

My research topics include environment perception especially road surface conditions for unmanned ground vehicles, aiming at safer and more comfortable autonomous driving.
I am interested in 3D vision technologies, with their applications in practical engineering tasks.
