## RSRD-segmentation dataset
From RSRD, we pick out 63 point cloud samples with irregular unevenness such as bump/pothole. In the *pcd* files, the points belonging to bump/potholes are labeled as **1** (see the red points below), while **0** (the black points below) for the others. RGB values are also attached for every point.
