I am Tong Zhao, pursuing Ph.D. degree at the School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. Yintao Wei. I am a visiting student at the [MSC Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/) in UC Berkeley, under the supervision of [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka]((https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/)). I received my Bachelor degree from Xiamen University (XMU) in 2020. 

My research topics include autonomous vehicle (AV) environment perception especially road surface conditions, aiming at safer and more comfortable autonomous driving.
I am interested in computer vision technologies, with their applications in practical engineering tasks.
